# PlayFieldFactoryBuilderObserver

## Pet project on java

I start this project for training my programming abileties and refer it to the people who want to see what coding skills i have.

For the first i want to say some words about what you can see on this repository. Its a couple of files with `.java` extension. They contained classes which designed with **observer** and **builder** design patterns. Also its using an **openGl** library for render of image.

What the result of it? Its not finished small game what looks like a blocks on a blocks which are fitings with ich other. You control a green one (VK_UP, VK_DOWN, VK_LEFT, VK_RIGHT).
